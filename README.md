## Inspiration
Cryptocurrency is gaining lot of potential and is proving to be trust worthy. With lot of attention around De-Fi and boom in crypto currency industry people are looking to enter this world. But, there is no proper standard way or tool to make transactions and view them in a simple layout. 

Budget Ledger solves this huge problem and serves as a bridge between Crypto markets and users of any level.
## What it does
Budget Ledger is a Web-App that helps you make Blockchain based Crypto transactions and stores all the transactions in a user friendly ledger. 

Main aim of Budget Ledger is to eliminate the hassle of checking complex and technical digital logs, records of Crypto transactions with a user friendly Layout to encourage people of all levels come and utilise the Crypto markets.

## How we built it
We have built it using Web stack like JavaScipt and HTML,CSS. The main frontend part is done by generating HTML through JS from database queries returned by Google Cloud. Bootstrap is used for styling. 

Blockchain based part is dependent on Ethereum network. We have used Rinkeby Test Network of Ethereum to execute the transactions. JS and solidity is mainly used for this part.

Chrome extension is done with Javascript and HTML,CSS .
## Challenges we ran into
Main challenges include connecting the complex blockchain technology based transactions to our web-app and storing those details in our Ledger. We have gone through many tutorials for ethereum and finished it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the end product we made at the end. This is our first time using GCP and Firebase as Database and took some time to understand. End of the day the transactions are recorded into databse seamlessly which is a huge win for us.
## What we learned
We have mainly learned about how to transact with Crypto from any web-app and sore the returned confirmations into Database.
## What's next for Budget Ledger
Budget Ledger is our First version where Transaction and storing of records is possible. We would like to extend this application to more crypto currency services like Lending and borrowing of Crytos with Uniswap or related De-Fi projects and also as mobile application for Android and iOS
